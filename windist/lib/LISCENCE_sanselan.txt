Sanselan: a Pure-Java Image Library
Introduction
This Pure-Java library reads and writes a variety of image formats, including fast parsing of image info (size, color space, icc profile, etc.) and metadata.
This library is pure Java. It's slow, consequently, but perfectly portable. It's easier to use than ImageIO/JAI/Toolkit (Sun/Java's image support), supports more formats (and supports them more correctly). It also provides easy access to metadata.
Although not yet version 1.0, sanselan is working and is used by a number of projects in production.
This project is Open Source; free as in freedom and free as in beer. It is available under the ASF (Apache) License. This is a non-viral Open Source license.
